# flutter_cubit_pagination 📲️

This project was quick made thinking to show how to use paginated APIs and Cubit to manage the app state with that feature.
It can be used as a bolierplate project. In this case I didn't worry about Celan Architecture because of the time that I spend in this development

## Next steps 💡️

1. Refactor to clean architecture
2. Improve the UI
3. Abstract the HTTP dependency
4. Add Dependency Injection

## Important ✅️
All these next steps I know how to do and you can see that on my another repositories, so when I developed this I just wanted to show how pagination works with cubits.

# Feel free to use as you want! 😁️
